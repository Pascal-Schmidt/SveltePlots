The main motivation to build SveltePlots was that we did not want to use proxy functions anymore for our dashboards and figure out updates for the charts. We also wanted to not use the `rendereUI` function anymore in Shiny to avoid re-rendering of charts.

```{r}
library(echarts4r)
library(dplyr)

# Example data: Multiple time series
df <- data.frame(
  date = seq.Date(as.Date("2023-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12),
  series1 = cumsum(rnorm(12)),
  series2 = cumsum(rnorm(12, 1, 1))
)

# The date where you want the vertical line
vline_date <- as.Date("2023-06-01")

# Create the chart
df %>%
  e_charts(date) %>%
  e_line(series1, name = "Series 1") %>%
  e_line(series2, name = "Series 2") %>%
  e_mark_line(data = list(xAxis = vline_date), 
              title = list(show = TRUE, formatter = "Vertical Line"),
              lineStyle = list(type = "solid", color = "red")) %>%
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") %>%
  e_x_axis(type = "time") %>%
  e_datazoom(type = "slider")

```
